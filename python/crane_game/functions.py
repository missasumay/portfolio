Toys will be displayed on the grid as colorful squares.\n3. When asked, you will need to provide a number from 1 to 6 to decide how far up and how far right you want to go to catch a toy.\n4. If you're gonna miss a square with a toy, the round will start again (don't worry, grid won't be reset).\n5. If you'll input correct coordinates, the game will then calculate your chances of actually catching the toy.\n6. If the almighty gods of Python will decide that you can catch the toy, the corresponding icon on the grid will be changed to a white square and you'll see the name of the toy you got.\n7. Game continues until you catch all the toys.\n\nHave fun!\n")
